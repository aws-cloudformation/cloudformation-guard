"""A stand-in for api.github.com's releases endpoint that returns a scripted response sequence.

The install scripts' backoff exists for responses only the real API produces, and only when its
quota is already spent -- which is not a state a test can ask for. Pointing the scripts at this
instead makes the sequence an input: the Nth request gets the Nth response in the scenario,
so `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` and retry exhaustion each become a deterministic case.

Every request is appended to the log file as `<monotonic_ms> <status> <auth|noauth>`, one line per
request. The gaps between those timestamps are what the delay assertions read, and they are
measured on this side rather than the caller's so they cannot be confused with process startup.

The third field records whether an Authorization header arrived. Overriding the API base URL is
also a way to send a bearer token somewhere it does not belong, so the scripts refuse to attach one
to any host but api.github.com -- and this is what lets a test hold them to that with a token
actually set in the environment.

Usage:
    stub_github_api.py --scenario <name> --port-file <path> --log-file <path>

The port is chosen by the OS and written to --port-file once the socket is listening, so
concurrent jobs on one runner cannot collide on a fixed number. A caller waits for that file to
appear before making its first request.

    `HTTPServer.server_bind` calls `socket.getfqdn()` on the bind address to fill in
    `server_name`. That is a reverse DNS lookup, and on a macOS CI runner 127.0.0.1 has no PTR
    record to find, so the call blocks until the resolver gives up -- measured as longer than the
    ten seconds the callers were willing to wait for the port file, with nothing on stderr because
    nothing had failed yet. It just had not returned.

    `server_name` is only used to build the CGI environment, which nothing here does, so the
    lookup buys this stub nothing and is skipped.

    Fixed here rather than by waiting it out. The callers' readiness timeout was later raised to
    30s for an unrelated reason -- a cold interpreter start on a Windows runner -- which would
    have hidden this stall instead of removing it, and a resolver that took longer than 30s would
    have brought it straight back.
