# Holds install-guard.sh's rate-limit handling to the behavior it was written for.
#
# Why this exists: the installer job that already runs in CI passes an explicit version and points
# GUARD_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL at a locally built archive. That makes get_version return early, so
# get_latest_release, github_api and backoff_seconds are never entered -- a regression in
# `Retry-After` handling, in `X-RateLimit-Reset` handling, or in the retry ceiling would leave that
# job green. Everything below drives the real entry point with no -v, so the lookup is taken.
#
# Why a stub rather than the real API: the code under test only runs on responses the API sends when
# its quota is spent. A test cannot ask api.github.com for a 429, and one that waited for a real
# limit would be neither fast nor deterministic. GUARD_API_BASE_URL exists so the response sequence
# can be an input.
#
# The assertions are on the delays the script announces AND on the request arrival gaps the stub
# measures. The announced value alone would pass if the script printed the right number and slept
# for the wrong one; the measured gap alone is a lower bound that cannot distinguish 1s from 2s
# reliably on a loaded runner. Together they pin both.

# Which shell runs the installer under test. Defaults to `sh`, which is what a caller gets.
#
# Overridable because `sh` is not one shell. install-guard.sh declares `#!/bin/sh` and the behavior of
# some of its constructs differs by implementation: arithmetic on a non-numeric value is harmless in
# bash and fatal in dash, and dash is `/bin/sh` on Debian and Ubuntu. A host whose `/bin/sh` is bash
# therefore cannot exercise the case the header-validation guards exist for, and a suite that only ever
# runs one shell reports coverage it does not have.
#
# Measured, with the probe `_reset=not-a-number; _now=100; echo $((_reset - _now + 1))`:
# bash prints -99 and exits 0; dash 0.5.13.5 exits 2 with "Illegal number: not-a-number"; ksh exits 1
# with "not: parameter not set".
#
# That probe is only half of it, and the half it leaves out is why there is a ksh job as well as a dash
# one. How each shell reacts to bad arithmetic decides how much a missing guard costs; how each shell's
# `[` reacts to a non-numeric operand decides whether a guard written as a numeric test works at all.
# Probe two, `_reset=not-a-number; [ "$_reset" -ge 0 ]`: bash and dash both fail it, so the guard holds,
# while ksh evaluates the operands arithmetically -- `not - a - number` is three unset names, sums to 0,
# and `0 -ge 0` is true -- so the guard passed the value through to the arithmetic that then aborted.
# A suite running only bash and dash reported the guard working on every shell it tried and still had
# the defect. is_digits in install-guard.sh is the portable form; GUARD_TEST_SH=ksh is what holds it
# to being portable rather than merely present.

# What this run can and cannot discriminate, measured on the shell in hand rather than assumed from
# its name.
#
# Two independent shell properties decide that, and the cases below depend on both. Whether the
# reset-not-a-number case is a live control depends on the arithmetic: on a shell that aborts, a
# missing guard costs the backoff outright and the case fails; on one that shrugs, the case passes
# whether the guard is there or not. Whether that case can tell a *portable* guard from a numeric test
# depends on `[`: the old `[ "$_reset" -ge 0 ]` spelling was rejected by bash and dash and admitted by
# ksh, so only a shell in the second group ever saw the value reach the arithmetic anyway.
#
# The combination matters because three of the four are green and only one of those three proved
# anything. A vacuous pass and a discriminating one are the same exit code, so the distinction has to
# be written down where a reader of the CI log will see it.
