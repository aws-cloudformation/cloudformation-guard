The rules can represent company policy guidelines related to security, compliance, and more\. The structured hierarchical data can represent cloud infrastructure described as code\. For example, you can create rules to ensure that they always model encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) buckets in their CloudFormation templates\.
