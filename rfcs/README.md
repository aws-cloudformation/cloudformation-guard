# CloudFormation Guard Request for Comments (RFCs)

Most bug fixes, doc enhancements, and small, incremental improvements for AWS CloudFormation Guard can be surfaced and resolved via GitHub issues and pull requests. However, any suggestions for substantial changes to the ruleset language or tooling should be documented and actioned upon via a request for comments (RFC). This will provide a standardized process for discussion of major improvements to the tooling and ruleset language.

### Submit a PR
Submit a Pull Request to the AWS CloudFormation Guard repository. The pull request will be reviewed by CloudFormation team members and open source contributors.

### Review State

### Approved
If approved, the RFC has been accepted for enhancement, and work can begin to accomplish what is set out in the PR. Accepted PRs will be kept in the repo for reference.
